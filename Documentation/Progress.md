I compiled and ran a demo plugin on the 64-bit version of Notepad++. I ran across trouble trying to run the provided plugin template with either 64-bit or 
32-bit notepad++ - so I haven't been able to build my own plugin yet. My own plugin is currently developed based off of the provided template, with some 
alterations.

I've been searching for a compatible template for x64-bit Notepad++, but failed so far. I've installed a .dll decompiler (dotpeek) in hopes of restoring the 
demo plugin and using it as a template.
